## How it works
If you click **Add Text File** button or **Add Binary File** button, the app will store the corresponding file located in the **assets** folder into IndexedDB. And the app gets the file from IndexedDB again and shows the file information simply. 

You can see the files in  IndexedDB by using Chrome Developer Tools.
