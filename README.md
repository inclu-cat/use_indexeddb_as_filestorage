## How it works
If you click **Add Text File** button or **Add Binary File** button, the app will store the corresponding file located in the **assets** folder into Indexed DB. And the app gets the file from Indexed DB again and shows the file information simply. 

You can see the files in  Indexed DB by using Chrome Developer Tools.
